**Introduction**

In recent years, danceability has emerged as a vital metric for evaluating the musical characteristics of various artists and genres. Danceability reflects how suitable a track is for dancing, incorporating elements such as tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall musical energy. As defined by Spotify, a score of 0.0 indicates the least danceable track, while a score of 1.0 signifies the most danceable. This metric has not only become a standard in understanding music's physical appeal but also serves as a tool for analyzing broader trends in the evolution of an artist's sound. 

The significance of danceability lies in its role in shaping how music is consumed and appreciated in the modern era. With the advent of digital streaming platforms, metrics like danceability play a central role in defining playlist recommendations and influencing audience engagement. For listeners, it bridges the gap between auditory and physical experiences, while for artists, it provides a quantitative measure of how their music resonates rhythmically with audiences.

This paper investigates the evolution of danceability in the music of three prominent artists—Ed Sheeran, JJ Lin, and G.E.M.—across their respective discographies from 2010 to 2024. Ed Sheeran, known for his wide-ranging appeal and pop-folk roots, consistently produces tracks with strong rhythmic and melodic elements. JJ Lin, a celebrated figure in the Mandopop industry, has experimented extensively with different musical styles over the years, incorporating varying levels of rhythmic energy. G.E.M., a versatile artist in the Chinese music scene, has successfully integrated danceable elements into her repertoire while maintaining her unique musical identity.

Through an analysis of the danceability scores of these artists' albums over time, this study identifies distinct patterns and trends. Ed Sheeran demonstrates a stable and consistently high level of danceability, suggesting his focus on creating universally appealing, rhythmically engaging tracks. In contrast, G.E.M. shows moderate variability, progressively incorporating more danceable elements as her career evolves. JJ Lin, however, exhibits the most fluctuation in danceability, reflecting phases of experimentation and a recent shift back toward producing rhythmically engaging music.

The findings provide insights into the interplay between an artist’s creative evolution and audience expectations. This paper not only highlights the unique journeys of these three musicians but also underscores the broader relevance of danceability as an evolving dimension of musical expression. By examining these trends, this study contributes to understanding how artists adapt their musical styles over time, influenced by both personal artistic choices and cultural trends in the music industry.
